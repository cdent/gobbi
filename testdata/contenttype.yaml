# Don't require content type on PUT, POST and PATCH requests
# in the test case. Instead allow testing of how the WSGI app handles
# it.

# This had been done initially to try to enforce some accuracy
# in the created tests, but real-world use has shown we need to
# be able to create tests that demonstrate that a server is behaving
# poorly (and not requiring a content-type).

tests:
    - name: put no content-type 
      desc: P methods should 400 when no content-type
      url: /
      data: '"moo"'
      method: PUT
      status: 400

    - name: post no content-type 
      desc: P methods should 400 when no content-type
      url: /
      data: '"moo"'
      method: POST
      status: 400

    - name: patch no content-type 
      desc: P methods should 400 when no content-type
      url: /
      data: '"moo"'
      method: PATCH
      status: 400

    - name: put content-type 
      desc: P methods should 400 when no content-type
      url: /
      data: '"moo"'
      request_headers:
